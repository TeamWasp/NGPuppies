# NGPuppies
Telerik Academy Final Project

## Description:
NG Puppies is an application intended for automatic utilities service payments. It provides a connection between a client (e.g., bank or other financial institution) and a telecom company. The telecom company administers the application and provides data to the bank about bills of the bank’s subscribers. The bank can see the bills related to its subscribers and pay them as single transactions or as bulk payments. It can also view history of made payments and statistics about its subscribers (e.g., top ten subscribers with largest bill payments, mean and total amount of paid bills for a given subscriber).

Authentication to the application is provided from the backend (server) of the application via JWT token after providing correct username and password at login time. After successful login the token is saved in the local storage of the page. The token contains information about the username, role, and whether this is the user’s first login into the system or not. Each token is valid for 15 minutes.

Note: Further detailed description can be found in the user's manual (data folder).
